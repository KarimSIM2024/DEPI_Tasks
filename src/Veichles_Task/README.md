Absolutely, here’s an explanation of each part of the `VehicleManager` class:

### Methods in `VehicleManager`

1. **`run` Method**:
    - This method is the main loop that drives the program.
    - It displays a menu to the user with options to add, view, modify, and analyze vehicles, as well as exit.
    - The user’s choice determines which method is called (e.g., `addVehicle`, `viewVehicles`).

2. **`addVehicle` Method**:
    - This method allows the user to input details for a new vehicle (make, model, year, price, and mileage).
    - The input values are used to create a new `Vehicle` object, which is then added to the `vehicles` list.

3. **`viewVehicles` Method**:
    - It simply iterates over the `vehicles` list and prints each vehicle using the `toString` method in `Vehicle`.
    - This provides a straightforward way to see all stored vehicles.

4. **`modifyVehicle` Method**:
    - This method allows the user to modify details of an existing vehicle in the list.
    - The user selects a vehicle by index, and then can update any of its fields (make, model, year, price, mileage).

5. **`performAnalysis` Method**:
    - This method displays a submenu with various analysis options, each performing a different operation on the `vehicles` list:
        - **Find Vehicle with Lowest Mileage**: Identifies and displays the vehicle with the lowest mileage.
        - **Count Vehicles After 2020**: Counts how many vehicles in the list were manufactured after 2020.
        - **Average Price of All Vehicles**: Calculates and displays the average price of all vehicles.
        - **Vehicle with Highest Price**: Finds and displays the vehicle with the highest price.
        - **Vehicles Priced Below $20,000**: Lists all vehicles with prices under $20,000.
        - **Sort Vehicles by Year**: Sorts and displays vehicles by their manufacturing year in ascending order.
        - **Vehicles of Make "Toyota"**: Filters and displays vehicles with the make "Toyota".
        - **Total Mileage of All Vehicles**: Calculates and displays the total mileage across all vehicles.
        - **Average Year of Manufacture**: Calculates the average manufacturing year for all vehicles.
        - **Oldest Vehicle**: Finds and displays the make and model of the oldest vehicle.
        - **Vehicles with Mileage Above 20,000**: Lists all vehicles with mileage greater than 20,000 miles.
        - **Vehicles Manufactured in 2021**: Checks if there is any vehicle manufactured in 2021.
        - **Display Vehicles in Reverse Order**: Shows all vehicles in reverse order of their addition.
        - **Vehicle(s) with Longest Mileage**: Identifies and displays the vehicle(s) with the highest mileage.

### Overall Flow

- **User Interaction**: The `run` method repeatedly presents a main menu, so users can continuously interact with the program. Each choice in the menu calls specific methods to add, view, or analyze vehicles.
- **Flexible Analysis**: The `performAnalysis` method has a dedicated submenu, which makes it easy to access various analysis options without cluttering the main menu.
- **Data Management**: The `vehicles` list stores all `Vehicle` objects, acting as the data source for all operations.

This setup provides an interactive and dynamic way for the user to manage and analyze a collection of vehicles, with options for viewing, modifying, and running various types of analyses on the stored data.





In Java, the `->` and `:` symbols serve different purposes in `switch` statements, especially with the newer "enhanced" switch expressions introduced in Java 12 (standardized in Java 14). Here’s a breakdown of the differences:

### Traditional `switch` with `:`

In the traditional `switch` syntax, the `:` symbol is used to mark each case block. After each case, `break;` is typically needed to prevent fall-through (i.e., prevent the program from executing subsequent cases even if they don’t match).

#### Example

```java
int day = 3;
String dayType;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
    case 7:
        dayType = "Weekend";
        break;
    default:
        dayType = "Weekday";
        break;
}
System.out.println(dayType);
```

### Enhanced `switch` with `->`

The enhanced `switch` expression syntax uses `->` for each case. Each case can either be a single expression or a block. The main advantages of this are:
- **No need for `break;`** — each case is isolated, and there is no risk of fall-through.
- **Can return a value** — `switch` expressions can return a result directly, making them useful in assignments and more concise.

#### Example

```java
int day = 3;
String dayType = switch (day) {
    case 1, 7 -> "Weekend";
    default -> "Weekday";
};
System.out.println(dayType);
```

### Key Differences

| Traditional `switch` (`:`)                     | Enhanced `switch` (`->`)                          |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Requires `break;` to avoid fall-through.       | Automatically prevents fall-through.              |
| Cannot directly return a value.                | Can return a value directly (useful in assignments). |
| Syntax for multi-statement blocks is less compact. | Allows concise syntax with `->` or block syntax `{ }`. |
| Available in all Java versions.                | Introduced in Java 12 (standard in Java 14+).     |

### When to Use Which Syntax

- Use `->` if you want a concise syntax and are using Java 12+.
- Use `:` for more complex logic where fall-through might be needed (although such cases are rare).
